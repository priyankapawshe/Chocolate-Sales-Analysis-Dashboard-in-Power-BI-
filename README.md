# Chocolate-Sales-&-Analysis-Dashboard 
This repository will provide detailed information of "Chocolate Sales & Analysis Dashboard in Power BI " project.

📊 I recently created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze chocolate sales data.
The dashboard provides end-to-end insights, covering:
✅ Sales Performance – overall revenue trends and profit margins
✅ Customer Analysis – demographics, preferences, and purchasing behavior
✅ Product Insights – top-selling chocolates, seasonal demand patterns
✅ Regional Performance – comparison of sales across different locations
✅ Interactive Filters & Drilldowns – for decision-makers to explore data easily
Tools & Skills Used:
 🔹 Power BI (Data Modeling, Interactive Visuals) 
 🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power Query
 🔹 Business Intelligence storytelling
This project helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization and analytics, turning raw sales data into actionable insights for better business decisions.
